Short-Term:
-handle updating the highlights when adding a new shift
-fix the bug that's adding copies of a shift on the same day
-automatically popup with the shift editor when creating a shift, and communicate that a new shift was created,
 to help avoid accidentally creating a shift.
-confirm that a new shift was created after it's created, and communicate which one was created, to facilitate
 correcting mistakes.
-add notes for availabilities and shifts
-make the colors more unique somehow
-fix the authorization loop when trying to update account/password


Long-Term:
-allow multiple availabilities/shifts per day
-make filtered-out shifts un-editable on large screens
